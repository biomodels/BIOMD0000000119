## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000119.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000119.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000119 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes


Model is according to the paper _Contribution of Persistent Na+ Current and
M-Type K+ Current to Somatic Bursting in CA1 Pyramidal Cell: Combined
Experimental._ This is the second model from this paper for the non-zero
[Ca2+] initial value, parameters and the kinetics quations from Table2 in the
paper. Figure9Aa has been reproduced by MathSBML. The original model from
ModelDB. http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/
